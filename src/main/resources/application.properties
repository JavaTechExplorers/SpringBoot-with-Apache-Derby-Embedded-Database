# By default Spring Boot will look for a property file in the package root directory called 'application.properties', this is a good place to customize your application. 
# For example, as we have placed mysql connector jar in the pom.xml file, Spring Boot will look for mysql specific properties in this file. 
# By Maven conventions, place this file into the src/main/resources directory so your build artefacts will be generated correctly. 

# Show or not log for each sql query

# Hibernate ddl auto (create, create-drop, update): with "create-drop" the database
